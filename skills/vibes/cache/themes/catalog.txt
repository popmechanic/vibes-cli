VIBES THEME CATALOG
===================

Available layout themes for app generation. Each theme defines a MOOD and
PERSONALITY — not a rigid template. Read the theme file for design principles,
color tokens, and reference styles, then interpret freely for each app.

CREATIVE LIBERTY
----------------

Themes are mood boards, not cookie-cutter layouts. Two apps using the same
theme should FEEL related but LOOK different. The LLM should:

  - USE the color tokens exactly (they define the mood identity)
  - FOLLOW the design principles (border style, typography feel, animation tempo)
  - INVENT unique layouts, card designs, and visual details per app
  - VARY hover effects, empty states, decorative elements, spacing
  - KEEP the same functional components across themes (so switching works)

The reference CSS in each theme file is ONE possible interpretation.
Study it to understand the aesthetic, then create your own version.

THEME COUNT: 1 TO 3
--------------------

The user chooses how many themes (1-3). The LLM must:

  1. Read this catalog and the user's prompt
  2. Pick the MOST SUITABLE themes (up to the requested count)
  3. Read ONLY the selected theme files — do NOT read files you won't use
  4. Generate completely different layouts per theme (not just color swaps)
  5. If 2+ themes: wire up useVibesTheme() for runtime switching

IMPORTANT — Lazy file reads:
  - Read this catalog FIRST (it's small, just summaries)
  - THEN read only the theme files you selected
  - Each theme file is large — reading unnecessary ones wastes time and tokens

The selection criteria:
  - Match app content type to each theme's BEST FOR list
  - Eliminate themes listed as NOT FOR this app type
  - If 2+ themes: prefer variety — themes should feel distinct from each other
  - Default is always a safe pick but don't default to it blindly

Example selections (3 themes):
  "Recipe book app"       → scrapbook, archive, industrial
  "Crypto dashboard"      → vault, industrial, poster
