THEME: default
NAME: Neo-Brutalist
MOOD: Bold, graphic, utilitarian

DESCRIPTION:
The standard Vibes layout. Card-based grid with thick borders, hard shadows,
and a utilitarian aesthetic. Mobile-first responsive. Best for general-purpose
apps that need flexibility — forms, dashboards, trackers, CRUD.

BEST FOR:
  - Data entry apps, forms, CRUD
  - Dashboards with multiple data views
  - Trackers, planners, organizers
  - Multi-section apps with tabs
  - Apps that need flexibility above visual flair

NOT FOR:
  - Visual portfolios / galleries (use archive)
  - Single-item showcases / landing pages (use industrial)

DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
  - Rounded corners (8-14px on cards, 6px on buttons/inputs)
  - Soft offset shadows or glows for depth
  - Generous padding and spacing
  - Warm, inviting color palette (amber/gold dark themes work well)
  - Aurora/gradient background effects welcome
  - Playful hover effects: lift, scale, bounce, glow
  - Standard card grid, no split-pane or hero section

  Use the pre-styled component catalog (card, btn, input, badge, tabs, etc.)
  but style them with personality. Two default-themed apps should look like
  siblings, not twins.

TOKEN OVERRIDES:
  Use `--comp-*` tokens in `:root`. Choose warm/cool/vibrant palettes
  that match the app's purpose. The tokens below are ONE example:

  ```css
  :root {
    --comp-bg: oklch(0.18 0.04 60);
    --comp-accent: oklch(0.72 0.18 70);
    /* ... adapt hues, saturation, lightness to your app */
  }
  ```

PERSONALITY:
  This theme feels approachable and fun. Like a well-designed indie app.
  Use animations generously — entrance fades, hover bounces, micro-
  interactions that make the UI feel alive. Rounded shapes and soft edges.
  Let the brand personality of the specific app guide your choices.
